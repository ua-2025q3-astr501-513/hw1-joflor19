# Part 5: Providing Project Ideas (1 points)
#
# * Objective:
#   Provide draft project ideas in order to form teams.
# * Details:
#   * This part ensures student start putting time to brainstorm their
#     (mid-term) projects.
#   * Your submission should include three project ideas based on the
#     topics that are covered in the first half of this course:
#     * Data Representation and Errors
#     * Numerical Linear Algebra
#     * Fourier Transform and Spectral Analysis
#     * Interpolation and Extrapolation
#     * Numerical and Automatic Derivatives
#     * Numerical Integration of Functions
#     * Root Finding and Optimization Methods
#     * ODE Integrators
#     * PDE Solvers
#   * You submission will be a well formatted YAML file `hw1/p5.yaml`.
#
# About YAML:
# * YAML (short for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable
#   format for data storage and configuration.
# * YAML uses Python-style indentation for nesting and avoids the use
#   of extraneous characters, making it easy to read.
# * Comments in YAML start with `#` and continue until the end of the line.
#
# Submission Requirement:
# * Your submission must be a valid YAML file that can be read by Python.
# * It should contain a list of three dictionaries, each with the following keys:
#   * "topic": Choose one of the topics listed above.
#   * "idea": Provide a short, clear, and concise description of your project idea.
#
# Below is a sample project idea.

# TODO: Edit this sample idea.

- topic: Fourier Transform and Spectral Analysis
  idea: Using publicly available raw stellar data (such as from MAST), apply signal 
  processing techniques (denoising, normalization, filtering) to analyze spectra

- topic: Root Finding and Optimization Methods
  idea: Comparison of optimization techniques in galaxy profile simulations. 
  Synthesize a basic galaxy image and fit a model to the image. Compare different
  optimization methods to minimize errors. 

- topic: Numerical Integration of Functions
  idea: Using Newton's laws of motion, simulate motion through different integration
  methods and determine the orbital period. Compare this period to the period found by 
  Kepler's laws. Determine errors and compare across different methods
        

# TODO: Add two more project ideas below, following the same format as
# the example above.
# Remember to ensure that each idea is distinct and concise, and each
# "topic" must be one of the listed course topics.
